      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p> My name is Kenneth Lloyd Pryor.I was born in Deland, Flordia on 01/31/1999 during the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIII" target="_blank">Superbowl</a>.I grew up with computers
        and was always good with computers or any form of technology.I remember when we didnt have internet when I was 12
        so I would take my laptop to the corner of our front porch and use our neighbors Wi-Fi which was only 1 bar but it
        worked.I started working at 16, my first job was detail at a Hyundai Dealership.I washed cars and did little things
        like take out the trash and stuff.About a year later, I moved into the parts department and was a counter-person
        for about another year.I took a web-development course in high school and learned basic HTML and CSS.I graduated
        Baldwin High School in 2017 and moved to Atlanta that fall.<br><br> I started work as a service advisor at Thornton
        Rd Hyundai and still currently doing that.I enrolled into a Coding Bootcamp @ Georgia Tech in 2018. I'm very outgoing
        and naturally a leader.My greatest weakness is I over think alot of things.
